Today i'm Studygm SQL

SQL  is a linguager from programn from Microsof
he is use to do Database ,
he is a big help to we programns 
Now me spenk a little about comand

CREAT DATABASE Name_Database; : here is where you create your DataBase you can put any name in your database

CRETE TABLE Name from table; : that comamd it use to creat a new table 
where this wrife Name from table is the name what you go put in table

Insert into Name_table Values  ('Roberto','13'),('Maria','12') : Insert into is a comand what you can put values or value in your table 
to you put  values you need use () to put and ofter use '' to put values so while over  is want put other value put ,

drop table or Drop database: you Drop a table or a database

Alter Table Name_var ADD column Name_column :  this comand creat a column  in your table this comand,
it's very good to you becase if you forget of put a column you to place ofter

Alter Table  Name_var Modify column Name_colum type or other thing: this comand  can modify a column how type ,function or limit

Alter table  Name_var change column Name_exist (other name) type :Comand to replace the name from column and the type

Alter Table  Name_var rename New_var : you too can replace the name from Table

Where : Where in SQL is type a if and else i think
he is type a conditional ,he just go do this if the conditional  is true
you go use much that
i recommend you find in internet that 

Update  Name_var set (Name from column) = 'Something' where Id = '2':Now Update is very Literal you can Update a column

Delete from  Name_table where Id = '10':Too explicate you can delete something from a column 

Truncate Table Name_table: you delete all from a table

* : He in SQL e  all
Select * from Name_table: This comand show all from a table but
you can just show one thing or more
EX:

select Id,Name,year from Name_table

you can organize the table in order usando Order by Name_column

EX:

Select Nome from Name_table 
order by;

You too can use operator logicians how (=,>,<,>=,<=.!=,not,and,or)

Ex:

Select Name,Year,Buy from Name_table Where
Buy > 20 and Year < 2022;

you can use Between

Ex:

select Name,Buy from Name_table where
Name_column Between '20' and '80'

Too have functions how (Max,Cont,Min and Sum)
EX:

Select max(Buy) from Name_table

Select Cont(ID) from Name_table

Select Min(Buy) from Name_table

Select Sum(Buy) from Name_table
